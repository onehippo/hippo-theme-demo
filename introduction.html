        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
          The hippo theme is a css / javascript library based on the
          <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> framework and includes
          <a href="http://www.angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> components.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from some <a href="#/css-core">base styling</a> of fonts, colors, tables etc it includes 2 grids and 2 types
          of components.
          The <a href="#/grid-systems">grid systems</a> are the standard Bootstrap grid system
          and another grid that uses absolute positioning to provide full height columns as needed in many webapps.
          The components are divided in:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="#/bootstrap-components">Bootstrap components</a> which are the basic Bootstrap components based on Bootstrap HTML CSS and Javascript.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="#/angular-components">AngularJS components</a> which are Hippo AngularJS directives.
              </li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
          Note: for AngularJS components, there is also an
          <a href="http://onehippo.github.io/hippo-theme-demo/docs/#/api">API reference</a> available.
